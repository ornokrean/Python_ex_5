=============================
Our code is designed in such a way that there is a class that receives the input from the user and analyzes
it. If the input contains the appropriate files, it passes it on to the next class that process the input.
this class divides the commands into separate sections and executes each section separately. Each section
consists of a filter and an Order. The department uses the filter package and the package of Order.
In this way we have created a modular code so that each layer realizes its exactly role. We will explain
later the modularity of each package.

In our code we used the single choice principle when we created a package for each element in the program.
If we want to add/remove/change filter, Order, or exception, we will need to change this in one
place only- in the class that represents the object we want to change / add / remove. The class that
manages the project does not "care" what is going on inside the packages, so it may prevent errors that may
arise from these classes, Because these classes handle all the exceptions associated with themselves. In
general, it can be said that there is no connection between the classes that use the packages that we
created and the classes themselves.
Also, each package we created has a super class and all the other classes inherited from it

In the filter - we have a general filter that is an abstract class, all the other
filters apply the filter. By requiring each filter to fulfill the abstract filter we prevent future
problems that may arise.

In the Order - we have an abstract order and all the type of order inherited from it

In the Exception - we have two type if exception and each exception inherit from the type of exception
appropriate to it.
