the code is packed in packages, and the hierarchy is that the filesprocessing package contains all the other
packages, and the packages inside are:

* FileProcessingExceptions package, that holds all the program exceptions classes:

BadFormatException.java - This Class extends TypeTwoException. this exception is kind of TypeTwoException
                            called when the problem is in the file format
FilterException.java - This Class extends TypeOneException. this exception is kind of oneTypeException called
                        when the problem is in the Filter line
OrderException.java - This Class extends TypeOneException. this exception is kind of oneTypeException called
                         when the problem is in the Order line
SourceException.java - This Class extends TypeTwoException. this exception is kind of TypeTwoException called
                        when the problem is in the source files
SubsectionException.java - This Class extends TypeTwoException. this exception is kind of TypeTwoException
                           called when the problem is in subsection in the command file
TypeOneException.java - This Class extends Exception. this exception is oneTypeException called when the
                        problem is in the line but we can make the default order or filter
TypeTwoException.java - this class extends exception. this is a kind of exception that alerts of fatal errors
                        in the program given values.
WrongArgumentsException.java - This Class extends TypeTwoException. this exception is kind of TypeTwoException
                                called when the problem is in the number of arguments in the program

* filters package, that holds all the filter classes:

AllFilter.java - Filter that pass all the files. Extends Filter class.
BetweenFilter.java - Filter that checks if file size is between (inclusive) the given numbers (in k-bytes).
                        Extends Filter class.
ContainsFilter.java - Filter that checks if the given value is contained in the file name (excluding path).
                        Extends Filter class.
ExecutableFilter.java - Filter that checks if file have execution permission. Extends Filter class.
FileNameFilter.java - Filter that checks if the given value equals the file name (excluding path).  Extends
                        Filter class.
Filter.java -  Filters will return all files in Source Directory that match a certain criterion. Only files
                are returned (not directories). Only files that are directly under the source directory are
                 returned (files that are in directories that are under the source directory should not be
                 returned). this is an abstract class which all the other filters extends.
FilterFactory.java - class that create an array with all the type of filters, using factory structure and
                        singleton- like data members - only one per each filter will be made and held.
GreaterThanFilter.java - Filter that checks if file size is strictly greater than the given number of given
                            k-bytes. Extends Filter class.
HiddenFilter.java - Filter that checks if the file a hidden file. Extends Filter class.
PrefixFilter.java - Filter that checks if the prefix of the file name is as the given value.  Extends Filter
                        class.
SmallerThanFilter.java - Filter that checks if file size is strictly less than the given number of k-bytes.
                            Extends Filter class.
SuffixFilter.java - Filter that checks if the suffix of the file name is as the given value.  Extends Filter
                    class.
WritableFilter.java - Filter that checks if file have writing permission (for the current user).  Extends
                        Filter class.

* orders package, that holds all the order classes:
AbsOrder.java - Class extends Order, determines the hierarchy between two files by the default.
Order.java - Class extends Order, determines the hierarchy between two files by the default.
OrderFactory.java - constructor, create array with all type of order comparator, using factory structure and
                    singleton- like data members - only one per each filter will be made and held.
SizeOrder.java - Class extends Order, determines the hierarchy between two files by the size of the file.  if
                    two files have the same size, the hierarchy will be determined by the default comparator.
TypeOrder.java - Class extends Order, determines the hierarchy between two files by the type of the file. if
                    two files have the same type, the hierarchy will be determined by the default comparator.

* in addition, we have the program managers inside the filesprocessing package:
DirectoryProcessor.java -  The Main class , get the argument from the user, checks if there is exactly two
                            arguments , and if so will run the project. otherwise it will print the error and
                             stop.
FileParsing.java -the file parsing class. the constructor will get two arguments: the filesDirectoryPath
                   which is the directory of the files to filter and order, and the commandFilePath which is
                   the actual filter and order values to act on. it will read the commands file, and will
                   print for each section inside the matching files. in event of wrong filter or order, the
                   program will use the default as constructed in the order and filter factories, and print
                   a warning in the matching line. in event of fatal error as wrong file address or
                   format (etc.) the program will throw a TypeTwoException. in order to run this
                   class is it needed to create an instance with the proper values and to run the parsefile
                   function.
