version 1.3

created by Evyatar and Mazya
Special thanks to Mr. Idan Gabay and Mr. David Nir for the QA

installation:
1. extract the folder "tester_files" and the files "run_tester" and "tester_python" to your ex5 folder (next to 'src')
2. double click 'run_test'

if 'run_test' does not work:
a. edit it and change the word 'python' to 'py' or 'python3' (change environment variable if you know how).
b. if 'a' does not work, launch 'tester_python' with PyCharm.


how to use:
1. run the test.
2. If you have any mistakes, the tester will print useful information about it.
3. If you want, you open and see your output and error files - 
	to do so, go to 'tester_files/tests' and there there will be of the tests.
	In each folder there are 9 files:
		a. commands - the commands file
		b. files that was created by the school solution (both data folders, output and errors)
		c. files that was created by your code (both data folders, output and errors)
				(by default the user files are my files, but after first use of the tester, your files will override them)
		
		

commants:
* I don't now if it will run on linux or mac
* I seperated the out.print and the err.print to 2 files (python did it for me), no order between them is checked.
* we have two data folders, 'simple' and 'complex', I added the school's files to them and added new files.
